# ArhanPassant

A UCI chess engine and chess library in Rust that keeps getting stronger. Every
new version learns from the engine's own self-play games, and it only replaces
the previous version after beating it in a statistical test over thousands of
games.

## Status

Version 0.12.0: NNUE network (8 king buckets, 8 output buckets), 512 hidden units, trained on 381.8M self-play positions. It passed its predecessor in 2,560 paired games at 8+0.08, gaining an estimated 12.4 Elo (95% interval 4.6 to 20.2). It is the 11th network in a row to pass the gate; every promotion is recorded in [`forge/ledger.json`](forge/ledger.json) with the games it took and the strength it gained.

Search changes are tested the same way, locally or on the cloud fleet: 6 were accepted (node-based time management, pawn-structure evaluation correction, piece-set evaluation correction, deeper/shallower re-searches, mop-up endgame knowledge, a history bonus for the move that made the opponent fail low), and 7 did not. Every result, including the failures, is in [`forge/tests.json`](forge/tests.json).

On Apple Silicon, the exact NEON neural output kernel measured 59.9% more nodes per second than the preceding optimized scalar build in nine alternating warmed benchmark runs per build. At the same 8+0.08 time control and with the same 0.12 network, it also passed a separate strength gate in 448 games: an estimated +80.5 Elo (95% interval +63.2 to +98.3). Both executable hashes and the test result are recorded in [`forge/tests.json`](forge/tests.json).

**Measured strength: about 3,426 on the CCRL Blitz scale** (95% interval 3,414 to 3,437 from game statistics alone), from 2,284 games at 60+0.6 against 8 versions of Demolito, Ethereal, Laser, Stash and Weiss with published CCRL Blitz ratings: each opponent's rating is read from the CCRL list and one rating is fitted to the 6 matches the engine scores 20-80% in; at 10+0.1, 5,200 games give 3,448 (3,436 to 3,459). Stronger engines are too far ahead to rate against: Stockfish 17.1 (CCRL 3,771) 3.9% of 400 games, Koivisto 9.0 (CCRL 3,632) 10.6% of 400 games. The matches ran before the last search changes were accepted. These are our own matches on cloud machines, not an official CCRL rating, and the opponents' own ratings carry another 10-20 Elo of uncertainty. Details: [`forge/engines.json`](forge/engines.json).

An earlier measurement, 480 games of version 0.7.0 against Stockfish 19 at fixed `UCI_Elo` levels of 2500, 2800, 3100, which Stockfish calibrates to the CCRL 40/4 list, gave about 3,026 ([`forge/anchors.json`](forge/anchors.json)).

## What is inside

- **Move generation**: legal moves from magic bitboards, matching 21 published
  perft results, including the 706,045,033-position test from the Chess
  Programming Wiki and Martin Sedlak's en passant and castling edge cases.
- **Search**: iterative deepening, aspiration windows, principal variation
  search, quiescence search, a lock-free shared hash table and lazy SMP threads;
  null-move, reverse futility, futility, late-move and static-exchange pruning;
  late-move reductions; singular extensions; history, continuation-history,
  killer and counter-move ordering.
- **Evaluation**: a (768 → N) × 2 → 1 NNUE with squared clipped ReLU, int16
  quantised and updated incrementally; tapered piece-square tables as the
  baseline.
- **Interfaces**: UCI, a Rust library (FEN, legal moves, SAN, perft) and a
  WebAssembly build that runs in browsers.
- **Self-improvement tooling**: self-play data generation, an NNUE trainer and a
  match runner with a calibrated sequential test.

## Quick start

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/arhanpassant bench
```

Add `target/release/arhanpassant` to any UCI chess GUI (Cute Chess, Arena,
Banksia, En Croissant). Options:

| Option          | Default      | Meaning                                          |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Hash`          | 16           | Hash table size in MB                            |
| `Threads`       | 1            | Search threads                                   |
| `Move Overhead` | 30           | Milliseconds kept in reserve per move            |
| `EvalFile`      | `<embedded>` | Network file, or `<none>` for the hand-written evaluation |
| `SyzygyPath`    | `<empty>`    | Folders of Syzygy tablebase files, separated by `:` |
| `SyzygyProbeLimit` | 7         | Largest piece count probed during search         |

With tablebases loaded, the engine plays only moves that keep the tables'
result at the root (the fastest wins, the slowest losses) and scores
positions the tables cover right after a capture or pawn move.

## As a library

```rust
use arhanpassant::Position;

let pos = Position::from_fen("r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3").unwrap();
for m in pos.legal_moves().iter() {
    println!("{} {}", m.to_uci(), pos.san(m));
}
assert_eq!(arhanpassant::perft(&Position::startpos(), 5), 4_865_609);
```

## How it gets stronger

1. **Self-play.** `arhanpassant datagen` plays games at a fixed number of nodes
   per move and stores every quiet position with its search score and the game
   result (32 bytes per position).
2. **Training.** `trainer/train.py` trains a network on those positions.
   `trainer/check_pipeline.py` proves the engine evaluates the exported network
   exactly as an integer re-implementation does, and that a scrambled export is
   caught.
3. **The gate.** `arena` plays the candidate against the champion in pairs of
   games (same opening, colours swapped) and runs a pentanomial sequential
   probability ratio test with bounds [0, 5] Elo and α = β = 0.05.
4. **Promotion.** Versions that pass are released and logged in the ledger, and
   become the opponent for the next round.

The gate is checked before it is trusted: on 600 simulated matches of known
strength it passes 5.0% of no-better versions and 95.2% of versions that really
are 5 Elo stronger (50.7% halfway between), an engine against an identical copy
measures exactly 0 Elo, and a deliberately broken likelihood ratio fails the
calibration test.

```sh
# a candidate network against the current engine
./target/release/arena \
  --engine name=candidate cmd=./target/release/arhanpassant opt.EvalFile=new.nnue \
  --engine name=champion  cmd=./target/release/arhanpassant \
  --tc 8+0.08 --book UHO_4060_v4.epd --concurrency 8 --games 40000 --sprt 0,5
```

## Repository

On macOS, keep self-play, training, network gates and the queued search
experiments running under a supervised service:

```sh
python3 forge/macbook.py install --cpu-budget 18 --min-new 80000000 --train-hidden 512
python3 forge/macbook.py status
python3 forge/test_queue.py add NAME "change description" parameter=value
python3 forge/macbook.py stop
python3 forge/macbook.py start
```

The current owner's profile uses an 18-core budget, 512 hidden units and starts a
new training round after 80 million fresh positions. If a search gate already has completed
pairs, it finishes that gate before training can change the network; a queued
test that has not started does not delay training. Other Macs can choose their own budget;
omitting it reserves two cores. While search tests
are pending, half the budget generates self-play and the rest plays test
games. Network gates pause self-play and use the full budget; training uses
Metal when available and eight parallel record decoders. Local gates save
completed pairs every 64 games and resume after a restart. A build, network,
book, settings or execution profile change starts a separate gate. Only a passed gate promotes
a network or accepts search settings; the settings also apply to self-play.

Self-play rotates into chunks of about one million positions. The controller
limits generated data to 14 GiB and pauses generation below 8 GiB of free
disk space. It retires only complete generated chunks that were included in
a successful training round, preserving untrained data, networks and match
evidence. The service restarts after a crash and starts at login. It prevents
idle sleep with a macOS assertion owned by the controller; stopping the service
releases it, and the display can still sleep. Pass `--allow-idle-sleep` when
installing to omit this assertion. Manual sleep and closing the lid can still
pause work. `status` reports idle-sleep protection, its current phase, fresh
positions, pending tests and saved gate results.

Milestone matches cover every version in the existing opponent suite plus
full-strength Stockfish 19: Stockfish 17.1, Koivisto 9.0, Demolito 2021,
Ethereal 12.00, Laser 1.7, Stash 28/31/34/37 and Weiss 1.2/1.3/1.4/2.0.
Prepare them on the Mac with the forge stopped, then reinstall its profile:

```sh
python3 forge/macbook.py stop
python3 forge/opponents.py --jobs 18
python3 forge/macbook.py install --cpu-budget 18 --min-new 20000000
```

The verified catalog enables milestone testing automatically. Each changed
champion network, executable or accepted settings creates a saved snapshot.
The controller alternates external batches with search batches within the
same CPU budget, using one thread and 64 MB hash on both sides. Each opponent
plays 200 games at 10+0.1 and 100 at 60+0.6, with colours reversed per opening.
Completed batches and game records survive restarts; a later promotion keeps
earlier unfinished suites. Results live in `DATA/forge/milestones/`, with
pair-based conservative 95% score intervals. These matches measure outside
opposition; the existing SPRT gates decide promotions. Historical cloud ratings
are not extrapolated from these Mac results.

Rejected or interrupted external batches keep their summary and game records
in numbered `NNNN-attempts/` archives before a retry reuses the output paths.
The adjacent `NNNN.attempts.json` records commands and errors. A batch gets at
most three attempts across restarts, including an interrupted launch. Exhausted
batches are listed in `blocked_matches`; other opponents and search tests keep
running. If only exhausted batches remain, the suite reports `needs_attention`
and stops scheduling games until the cause is investigated. Failed attempts
never enter the accepted game counts or score intervals.

Analyse saved losses with `forge/blunders.py` using the dependencies in
`forge/requirements-analysis.txt`. It compares Stockfish's preferred move
with the played move from the same position, at equal node limits and with
fresh search state. A preferred move has zero estimated loss; restricted
searches that disagree with the recommendation are counted separately.
Saved reports include input hashes and the reference build. These diagnostics
guide experiments; they do not establish a strength gain or replace match gates.
After every opponent has a completed initial batch, and again after the full
suite finishes, the controller reviews up to 32 saved losses with Stockfish 19.
The review replaces one external batch slot and uses its available cores beside
self-play. It freezes game records, the reference binary and the analysis code;
completed reviews survive restarts. Reports and bounded failure retries live in
the milestone's `diagnostics/` folder. Pass `--loss-analysis-sample 0` to the loop
to disable reviews, or another sample size to change their budget.

For a network-capacity experiment, append `--train-hidden 1024` when installing
the Mac profile. Training rounds use that width and the normal gate
compares the candidate with the current champion before any promotion. Omit
the option to choose capacity from the retained dataset size. This makes larger
models testable without expanding the self-play storage budget.

Training carries partial record buffers into the next batch and visits every
frozen training and validation row exactly once per pass. It uses one final
partial batch, weights losses and throughput by actual record counts, and sizes
the learning-rate schedule from the resulting number of optimizer steps. A
shortened frozen input or incomplete epoch fails the round instead of silently
reducing its dataset. Appended records remain outside the frozen prefix.

For an isolated fine-tuning study, provide both `--init-checkpoint model.nnue.pt`
and `--init-network model.nnue` to `trainer/train.py`, with the matching hidden
width and bucket counts. The checkpoint must re-export byte for byte to that
NNUE before training starts. Output files cannot overwrite either input, and
input hashes are checked again after training. Fine-tuning defaults to a
learning rate of `1e-5`; training from scratch keeps its `1e-3` default. The
`.init.json` sidecar records initialization, settings and selected checkpoint
hashes. This option does not change the supervised controller's training policy
or promote a model; a fresh strength gate remains required.

When a completed training round exports exactly the champion's network bytes,
the controller records its trained-data progress and skips the duplicate gate.
With an explicit champion file, an identical NNUE cannot create a new champion
version, even if a separately requested statistical test returns H1. Search and executable comparisons still
use their normal gates with the same network on both sides.

For a multicore search experiment, pass `common.Threads=3` to `test_queue.py add`
(saved as `"common_options": {"Threads": "3"}`). Both engines receive these options, and the controller
reduces concurrent games to fit their threads within the remaining CPU budget.
Common options are recorded with the evidence and are never promoted as tuned
settings. `smp_vote=1` is an experimental vote among completed main and helper
searches; its shipped default is zero until a strength test passes.

To compare executable changes locally, a queue entry can set `candidate_engine`
and `baseline_engine` (also accepted by `test_queue.py add`). Both sides use
the same champion network and accepted settings. The result records the hash
of each executable, and changing either starts a separate test. The Apple
Silicon neural output kernel uses NEON with exact i64 reduction; full evaluation
retains the scalar reference, and other architectures use the portable path.
